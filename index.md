# About

Hi, I am Haoyang Zhang, a Master’s student in Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia (UVA). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Microelectronic Science and Engineering from Fudan University (FDU), where I had the opportunity to work with Professor [Kun Wang](http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/people/kun-wang/index.html). I also had a internship at HiSilicon during summer 2024. 

My research interests are in the area of computer architecture, with a particular focus on domain-specific architectures (DSA) and hardware acceleration for machine learning: (i) Efficient AI hardware implementations, e.g., for LLMs and GNNs; (ii) DSA for optimized sparse matrix operations.
